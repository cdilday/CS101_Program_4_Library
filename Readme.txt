I, Christopher Dilday (cdilday@ucsc.edu), partnered with Alex Vincent, (avincent@ucsc.edu), for this project.

We collaborated by splitting making the ADT into two different kinds of functions to be handled, made them, combined them, and then tested them together in Listdr. Then, we split the work again for store.c and then recombined them, doing a significant amount of pair programming to debug and check for memory issues.

If you need any more information please let me know.
