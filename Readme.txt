I, Christopher Dilday (cdilday@ucsc.edu) madde this program alone. I enlisted the aid of a few friends when bugs appeared, but did not directly use code or work with anyone else.

Library.c is the main program, HashTable.c/.h is the HashTableADT, ListBook.c/.h is the first Linked List containing the title and book ID, and ListInt.c/.h is the linked list containing book IDs. The linked lists are based off the ADT I made for Program 2 when I worked with Alex Vincent, and their drivers may be a bit out of date as I changed a lot of things after making sure they worked so don't bother trying them. This definitely works with the provided files, so type "make" and then run "Libray <fileinput> <fileinputrequests>"

If you need any more information please let me know.
